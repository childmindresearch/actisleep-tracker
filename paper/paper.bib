  abstract = "In summary, although actigraphy is not as accurate as PSG for
              determining some sleep measurements, studies are in general
              agreement that actigraphy, with its ability to record
              continuously for long time periods, is more reliable than sleep
              logs which rely on the patients' recall of how many times they
              woke up or how long they slept during the night and is more
              reliable than observations which only capture short time periods.
              Actigraphy can provide information obtainable in no other
              practical way. It can also have a role in the medical care of
              patients with sleep disorders. However, it should not be held to
              the same expectations as polysomnography. Actigraphy is
              one-dimensional, whereas polysomnography comprises at least 3
              distinct types of data (EEG, EOG, EMG), which jointly determine
              whether a person is asleep or awake. It is therefore doubtful
              whether actigraphic data will ever be informationally equivalent
              to the PSG, although progress on hardware and data processing
              software is continuously being made. Although the 1995 practice
              parameters paper determined that actigraphy was not appropriate
              for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, more recent studies suggest
              that for some disorders, actigraphy may be more practical than
              PSG. While actigraphy is still not appropriate for the diagnosis
              of sleep disordered breathing or of periodic limb movements in
              sleep, it is highly appropriate for examining the sleep
              variability (i.e., night-to-night variability) in patients with
              insomnia. Actigraphy is also appropriate for the assessment of
              and stability of treatment effects of anything from hypnotic
              drugs to light treatment to CPAP, particularly if assessments are
              done before and after the start of treatment. A recent
              independent review of the actigraphy literature by Sadeh and
              Acebo reached many of these same conclusions. Some of the
              research studies failed to find relationships between sleep
              measures and health-related symptoms. The interpretation of these
              data is also not clear-cut. Is it that the actigraph is not
              reliable enough to the access the relationship between sleep
              changes and quality of life measures, or, is it that, in fact,
              there is no relationship between sleep in that population and
              quality of life measures? Other studies of sleep disordered
              breathing, where actigraphy was not used and was not an outcome
              measure also failed to find any relationship with quality of
              life. Is it then the actigraph that is not reliable or that the
              associations just do not exist? The one area where actigraphy can
              be used for clinical diagnosis is in the evaluation of circadian
              rhythm disorders. Actigraphy has been shown to be very good for
              identifying rhythms. Results of actigraphic recordings correlate
              well with measurements of melatonin and of core body temperature
              rhythms. Activity records also show sleep disturbance when sleep
              is attempted at an unfavorable phase of the circadian cycle.
              Actigraphy therefore would be particularly good for aiding in the
              diagnosis of delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome,
              non-24-hour-sleep syndrome and in the evaluation of sleep
              disturbances in shift workers. It must be remembered, however,
              that overt rest-activity rhythms are susceptible to various
              masking effects, so they may not always show the underlying
              rhythm of the endogenous circadian pacemaker. In conclusion, the
              latest set of research articles suggest that in the clinical
              setting, actigraphy is reliable for evaluating sleep patterns in
              patients with insomnia, for studying the effect of treatments
              designed to improve sleep, in the diagnosis of circadian rhythm
              disorders (including shift work), and in evaluating sleep in
              individuals who are less likely to tolerate PSG, such as infants
              and demented elderly. While actigraphy has been used in research
              studies for many years, up to now, methodological issues had not
              been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice.
              Those issues have now been addressed and actigraphy may now be
              reaching the maturity needed for application in the clinical
              arena.",

               AND SETTING: Data are from three studies that obtained 7 nights
               of actigraph data (using Mini Motionlogger actigraphs and
               associated validated algorithms [ASA]) on children and
               adolescents living at home on self-selected sleep-wake
               schedules. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 169 children aged
               12-60 months, and 55 adolescents aged 11-16 years. MEASUREMENTS
               AND RESULTS: Up to 28\% of weekly recordings may be unacceptable
               for analysis in young participants because of illness, technical
               problems, and participant noncompliance; studies aiming to
               collect 5 nights of actigraph data should record for at least 1
               full week. Reliability estimates for values aggregated over any
               5 nights were adequate (> or = .70) for sleep start time, wake
               minutes, and sleep efficiency. Measures of sleep minutes and
               sleep period were less reliable and may require 7 or more nights
               for estimates of stable individual differences. Reliability for
               1- or 2-night aggregates were poor for all measures. We found
               significant and high correlations between summer and fall
               session measures for all five variables when weekend nights were
               included. CONCLUSIONS: Five or more nights of usable recordings
               are required to obtain reliable actigraph measures of sleep for
               children and adolescents.",

              data from 7 nights of actigraph recordings and sleep diary and
              from a questionnaire. SETTING: Children studied in their homes.
              PARTICIPANTS: Fifty children, aged 4 to 7 years. MAIN OUTCOME
              MEASURES: Sleep start, sleep end, assumed sleep, actual sleep
              time, and nocturnal wake time derived from different methods.
              RESULTS: Differences between actigraphy and diary were +/- 28
              minutes for sleep start, +/- 24 minutes for sleep end, and +/- 32
              minutes for assumed sleep, indicating satisfactory agreement
              between methods, whereas for actual sleep time and nocturnal wake
              time, agreement rates were not sufficient (+/- 106 minutes and
              +/- 55 minutes, respectively). Agreement rates between actigraphy
              and questionnaire as well as between diary and questionnaire were
              insufficient for all variables. Sex and age of children and
              socioeconomic status did not influence the differences between

              be interchangeably used for the assessment of sleep start, sleep
              end, and assumed sleep but not for nocturnal wake times. The
              diary is a cost-effective and valid source of information about
              children's sleep-schedule times, while actigraphy may provide
              additional information about nocturnal wake times or may be used
              if parents are unable to report in detail. It is insufficient to

              clinical practice recommendations for the use of actigraphy in
              adult and pediatric patients with suspected or diagnosed sleep
              disorders or circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. METHODS: The
              American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task
              force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and
              assigned strengths based on a systematic review of the literature
              and an assessment of the evidence using the GRADE process. The
              task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the
              quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient
              values and preferences, and resource use considerations that
              support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved
              the final recommendations. RECOMMENDATIONS: The following
              recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians using
              actigraphy in evaluating patients with sleep disorders and
              circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, and only apply to the use
              of FDA-approved devices. Each recommendation statement is
              assigned a strength (``Strong'' or ``Conditional''). A ``Strong''
              recommendation (ie, ``We recommend…'') is one that clinicians
              should follow under most circumstances. A ``Conditional''
              recommendation (ie, ``We suggest…'') reflects a lower degree of
              certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the
              patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment
              regarding any specific care must be made by the treating
              clinician and the patient, taking into consideration the
              individual circumstances of the patient, available treatment
              options, and resources. We suggest that clinicians use actigraphy
              to estimate sleep parameters in adult patients with insomnia
              disorder. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use
              actigraphy in the assessment of pediatric patients with insomnia
              disorder. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use
              actigraphy in the assessment of adult patients with circadian
              rhythm sleep-wake disorder. (Conditional). We suggest that
              clinicians use actigraphy in the assessment of pediatric patients
              with circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder. (Conditional). We
              suggest that clinicians use actigraphy integrated with home sleep
              apnea test devices to estimate total sleep time during recording
              (in the absence of alternative objective measurements of total
              sleep time) in adult patients suspected of sleep-disordered
              breathing. (Conditional). We suggest that clinicians use
              actigraphy to monitor total sleep time prior to testing with the
              Multiple Sleep Latency Test in adult and pediatric patients with
              suspected central disorders of hypersomnolence. (Conditional). We
              suggest that clinicians use actigraphy to estimate total sleep
              time in adult patients with suspected insufficient sleep
              syndrome. (Conditional). We recommend that clinicians use
              actigraphy in place of electromyography for the diagnosis of
              periodic limb movement disorder in adult and pediatric patients.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: When assessing children's sleep using actigraphy,
              researchers usually rely on a sleep diary completed by a parent
              as an aid in scoring actigraphic data. However, parental
              nonadherence in completing the sleep diary may significantly
              reduce the amount of available data. The current study examined
              the agreement between actigraphic data scored with and without a
              sleep diary to evaluate the impact of not using a sleep diary
              when studying children's sleep with actigraphy. METHODS: Sixty
              children (aged 6-10 years; 36 girls) wore an actigraph for three
              to seven consecutive nights, and mothers were asked to complete a
              diary of their child's sleep during the same period. Actigraphy
              data were scored under two conditions (with and without diary)
              rated independently for each child by two different research
              assistants, who each scored 50\% of the files in each condition.
              RESULTS: Group-level analyses and intraclass correlations
              revealed very strong convergence between the two scoring
              conditions: on all sleep variables (sleep duration, wake
              duration, and sleep efficiency), average mean differences were
              very small and intraclass correlations very high. Bland and
              Altman's (1999) approach allowed for a child-by-child examination
              of agreement between the two conditions and revealed that,
              although they cannot be considered interchangeable, the two
              conditions produce quite minimal differences in the estimation of
              sleep variables. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that it is
              possible to use some actigraphy data for which no corresponding
              diary data are available, although this approach should be used
              sparingly.",

              The validity, reliability and limitations of actigraphy for
              documenting sleep-wake patterns have been addressed. Normative
              data on sleep-wake patterns across development have been

              actigraphy to distinguish between clinical groups and to identify
              certain sleep-wake disorders. Actigraphy has also been shown to
              be effective in documenting the effects of various behavioral and
              medical interventions on sleep-wake patterns. Actigraphy is less
              useful for documenting sleep-wake in individuals who have long

              individuals with motor disorders or high motility during sleep;
